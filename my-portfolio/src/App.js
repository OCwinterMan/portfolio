              I served as the 44th President of the <br/>
              United States. My story is the American story â€” <br/>
              values from the heartland, a middle-class <br/>
              upbringing in a strong family, hard work and <br/> 
              education as the means of getting ahead, and the <br/> 
              conviction that a life so blessed should be lived<br/> 
              in service to others.
